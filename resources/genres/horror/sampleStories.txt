Title: Whispers that Warp the Cosmos

1. "Do you feel that?" Nick asked, the hairs on the back of his neck standing up. The room was pulsating with unseen energy.
2. His skin began to harden and crack like dry earth. Each fissure revealed something crawling beneath the surface, pushing and wriggling to get out.
3. The old grandfather clock, which hadn't worked in years, suddenly chimed at 3 AM. 
   Michael and Vivien exchanged a worried glance, recalling the urban legend associated with it.
4. Meanwhile... In the moonlit room, Samantha's shadow stretched unnaturally long, reaching out and wrapping around Michael's shadow.
5. Each time Nick ate, his stomach distended unnaturally. He could see the outline of hands pressing from within, 
   as if something inside him was trying to escape.
6. As Vivien slept, her dreams manifested on her skin. Every nightmare etched itself in horrifying detail, 
   creating a tapestry of terror that she could never escape.
7. Vivien had a vision of an impending doom, but before she could voice it, she slipped on a banana peel. 
   "That... wasn't what I foresaw," she grumbled.
8. She felt a constant itch at the base of her spine. One day, she discovered budding wings, fleshy and raw, 
   stretching and tearing her skin as they grew.
9. "You feel that too?" Michael asked, his voice shaky. "The room... it's not just cold, Samantha. It feels like it's actively pushing us out."
10. The skin on his forearm started to twist and form words. Horrified, he read, "He is near." Samantha gasped, witnessing the gruesome message emerge.
With the curse lifted, Vivian felt a weight lift off her shoulders. The spirits had moved on, and she could finally live her life.
