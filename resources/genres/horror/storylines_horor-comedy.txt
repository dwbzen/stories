Vivien stared intensely into the abyss, her psychic energy pulsating. Suddenly, a toaster popped out a piece of toast. "I saw that coming," she deadpanned.
Nick tried to flex his newly mutated third arm, attempting to impress Samantha. "Looks like my workout is paying off, huh?" he said with a smirk. Michael, unimpressed, replied, "Three arms, and you still can’t juggle."
Vivien had a vision of an impending doom, but before she could voice it, she slipped on a banana peel. "That... wasn’t what I foresaw," she grumbled.
"Why is it always ancient curses with you two?" Nick exclaimed, observing Michael and Samantha covered in green slime. Samantha responded, "It's called variety, Nick."
Samantha, horrified, said, "There's something growing on your back, Michael!" Michael, trying to peek over his shoulder, replied, "Is it... a pimple? I knew I felt something!"
As monsters surrounded them, Michael optimistically said, "Well, on the bright side, none of them are your ex-boyfriends, right Sam?" Samantha rolled her eyes.
A sinister spirit began to float around the room, causing the lights to flicker. Vivien casually glanced up, "Oh, that’s just Larry. He's mostly harmless."
Michael held up a talisman. "This is our protection from evil!" Suddenly, it squeaked like a dog toy. Samantha laughed, "That's going to scare them?"
In a desperate moment, Nick yelled, "We need a plan!" Vivien responded, "I've got a vision! ...and it involves pizza." Nick sighed, "Focus, Vivien."
Samantha’s eyes widened in horror as worms began to crawl out of the ground. Michael leaned down and said, "See? I told you we'd find bait for fishing."
Vivien, sensing an otherworldly presence, declared, "There's a ghost here!" Nick sarcastically replied, "Really? I thought it was just a draft."
As a creature’s hand slowly emerged from the swamp, Michael joked, "Guess he just wants to give us a... wet handshake?"
Nick stared at his own reflection, horrified to see it slowly changing. Michael observed, "Always knew you had a few faces."
Samantha shouted, "Michael! There’s something crawling up your leg!" Michael responded, nonchalantly, "Oh, that’s just Fred. We’re friends now."
Vivien tried concentrating her psychic powers, but suddenly sneezed, causing all the furniture to levitate momentarily. "Allergies," she mumbled.
Samantha looked puzzled, "Why are these ghosts so... clingy?" Nick quipped, "Guess they heard about your breakups."
Michael, noticing a giant eye peeping through the window, joked, "Seems like we have a Peeping Tom. Or should I say, a Peeping Monster?" Samantha groaned.
Michael found himself standing in front of a gravestone, his name etched on the cold stone. The date of death was today.
"The spirits are restless tonight," Vivian murmured, her psychic senses tingling. "Something terrible is about to happen."
Nick watched as the mirror fogged over, the words "You're next" appearing on the surface. He was alone in the room.
Vivien's voice began echoing from different directions. Michael joked, "Surround sound, the Vivien edition."
Nick's hands started aging rapidly, revealing lifelines that twisted into cryptic messages. Samantha, tracing the lines, remarked, "Looks like your future's a bit...written out."
Michael's freckles began shifting, forming constellations on his skin. "Did you join the galaxy's VIP list?" Vivien teased.
As Samantha's lips sealed shut, her voice began emerging from random objects. Michael picked up a talking shoe, "You always did have a foot in your mouth."
Vivien's feet started absorbing everything they touched. Soon, she had shoes made of shattered glass, old chewing gum, and lost coins. "A collector’s dream," she remarked, albeit nervously.
"Michael, why is your shadow...chewing?" Samantha asked, observing the silhouette gnawing on the ground. "Oh, he's on a diet," Michael replied.
As Vivien's hair began to tighten and coil around her, Nick exclaimed, "Looks like your hair really does have a mind of its own!" She rolled her eyes, struggling to free herself.
Every time Michael sneezed, a tiny version of him popped out, each one angrier than the last. Samantha remarked, "You're really not great company in bulk."
Samantha's hands started to wander off her arms at night. "Every morning it's like a scavenger hunt," she sighed, retrieving one from the cereal box.
Nick's tattoos began swimming around his body, each one attempting to escape the other. "It's like an aquarium," Michael observed, "only more...personal."
Vivien's ears grew larger each time she heard a secret. Samantha whispered, "At this rate, you'll fly away soon." Vivien responded with a smirk, "I'm all ears."
The veins in Michael's arms started to glow, creating a roadmap to places unknown. "Looks like a treasure map," Nick mused, "but with more blood."
Samantha's teeth, one by one, turned into tiny piano keys. "At least you have a killer smile," Michael quipped as he played a tune.
Nick's beard began growing at an alarming rate, tangling and trapping anything close. "That's one way to catch a meal," Michael remarked, pulling out a sandwich.
