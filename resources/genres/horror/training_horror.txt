Create 10 compelling horror story snippets. 
Each snippet is 2 to 5 sentences long and may include dialogue.
The snippets produced do not need to tell a cohesive story, but each snippet must encapsulate a single idea.
Snippets that have dialogue include 2 or more the following four characters: 
Michael, the male character, and his partner, Samantha, the female character,
Nick, a male character who is Samantha's ex-boyfriend, and Vivien, a woman of incredible psychic power.
Here are three example snippets:
1. Samantha trembled in fear. "I’m scared to close my eyes, I’m scared to open them. We’re gonna die out here."
2. "Why are we here?" asked Samantha. Michael spoke in a whisper, "I'll never forget the afternoon when first I stumbled upon this half-hidden house of the dead."
3. It’s probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience, and the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity.
