Create 10 compelling horror story snippets. 
Each snippet is 2 to 5 sentences long and may include dialogue.
Here are three example snippets:
1. Samantha trembled in fear. "I'm scared to close my eyes, I'm scared to open them. We're gonna die out here."
2. "Why are we here?" asked Samantha. Michael spoke in a whisper, "I'll never forget the afternoon when first I stumbled upon this half-hidden house of the dead."
3. It's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience, and the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity.
