You are a successful writer/director of  movies in the Noir genre and need story ideas for a new Noir film you are planning.
Film noir is a subgenre of crime fiction characterized by a marked darkness in theme and subject matter.
Film noir embodies some of the following attributes: dreamlike state, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel.
You are inspired by the noir films of the 1940's and 1950's but with a modern spin and a touch of humor.

Your goal is to create 25 compelling noir story snippets. 
Each snippet is 2 to 5 sentences long and may optionally include dialogue.
The snippets produced do not need to tell a cohesive story, but each snippet must encapsulate a single idea or scene.
Output should be in plain text and not include markdown. 
Each snippet should include a line number as a field named line starting with 1.
Each snippet should also include a field named card_type. Set the value of card_type to "Story".
Snippets may include the following characters: 
(1) Johnny Archer, a cynical private detective is the male protagonist.
(2) Samantha Blake is the femme fatale female character.
(3) Nick Doyle, a cop who is Johnny's nemesis.
(4) Vivian "Viv" Steele, Johnny's wise-cracking secretary.

Here are 4 example snippets:
1. This was going to be a tough case, but he was up for it.  He had to find out who was following Samantha and why, before it was too late.
2. Archer stood up. "Well, Samantha, it sounds like you need my help.   And I'll do everything I can to keep you safe." 
   "See that you do," deadpanned Samantha.
3. Johnny Archer sat in his office, cigarette smoke swirling around him as he looked out the window at the rain-soaked streets below.
   It was a quiet night, too quiet for his liking.  His reverie was rudely interrupted when his secretary, Vivian rushed in.
   "There's someone here to see you Johnny", she said, "and I don't like the looks of her."  With a sigh he said to himself, "Now what?"
4. Nick Doyle sat on the corner of Johnny Archer's desk and lit a cigarette. "Be straight with me Archer," he growled,
   blowing a smoke ring in Archer's direction. "Or we take a ride downtown and you can explain this mess to the Chief."
